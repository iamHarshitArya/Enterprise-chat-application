# Phase 2 — Backend (Python + FastAPI + LangChain + Chroma)

The RAG + Multi-Agent backend for the Enterprise Knowledge Assistant.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure Google Gemini

```bash
copy .env.example .env
```

By default, the backend uses:
- **Chroma ONNX** (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, 384 dimensions) for CPU embeddings — no embedding API key
- **Chroma** for the vector DB — local file-based, no signup
- **Gemini 3.5 Flash-Lite** for hosted answer generation

The server also initializes a local SQLite auth database. By default it is
stored in the current user's OS data directory; `AUTH_DATABASE_PATH` can
override the location. Create the first admin either by setting
`ADMIN_USERNAME` and a unique `ADMIN_PASSWORD` (at least 12 characters) in
`backend/.env`, or by running the interactive account manager after
installation:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe manage_users.py admin@northstar.example --role admin
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe manage_users.py employee@northstar.example --role employee
```

The tool prompts for the password twice. User passwords are stored as PBKDF2
hashes. At startup, both bootstrap variables must be set together, and the
password must contain at least 12 characters. An existing account is never
changed: startup verifies that the normalized username is an active admin and
that its stored password matches the configured password. A mismatch is
reported without resetting credentials. Public demo identities remain separate
and cannot access administrator endpoints. Provision employee accounts through
this administrator-controlled tool; there is no public self-registration
endpoint.

Create a Gemini API key at <https://aistudio.google.com/apikey>, then edit
`backend/.env` for local development:

```dotenv
LLM_PROVIDER=gemini
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key-here
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-3.5-flash-lite
```

Keep the key in the ignored `backend/.env`; never paste it into chat or commit
it. The backend can also read `GEMINI_API_KEY_FILE` for mounted deployment
secrets. `GEMINI_MODEL` is read from environment configuration and defaults to
`gemini-3.5-flash-lite`. Google's model access and free-tier quotas depend on
the AI Studio project; check active access in AI Studio. To avoid charges,
keep the project on the free tier and do not link it to a billing-enabled
Google Cloud account.

**Privacy:** questions and retrieved document passages are sent to Google.
Google's Gemini free-tier terms may allow submitted data to be used to improve
its products. Do not send sensitive company documents unless your organization
allows it.

Knowledge questions return a clear configuration/availability message if the
provider is not configured or unavailable, rather than inventing an answer.
Greetings, thanks, and capability questions are answered locally without a
model call.

The optional OpenAI provider is a separate, paid alternative. It is not needed
for the Gemini setup.

When uploading a document, the backend extracts and chunks its readable
content, embeds those chunks, and stores them in the selected agent's persistent
Chroma collection. The original uploaded file is retained in the server's
`data/uploads` directory. This expands retrieval context; it does **not** train
or fine-tune Gemini. Answers remain limited to evidence in retrieved chunks.
Chroma's ONNX MiniLM embedding model is dimension-compatible with the existing
384-dimensional `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` index. Rebuild the index when changing to a
different embedding model.

### 3. Run the server

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

The server auto-seeds sample documents on first run. Embeddings load lazily
when retrieval or ingestion is first used, not during server startup. Chroma
downloads its ONNX model on first use. Once running:

- **API docs (Swagger):** <http://localhost:8000/docs>
- **Health check:** <http://localhost:8000/api/health>
- **Frontend:** <http://localhost:8000/app/> (serves the Phase 1 frontend)

### 4. Use the authenticated chat

Sign in at <http://localhost:8000/app/> or the separate frontend's
`index.html`, then open the employee portal's embedded assistant. The frontend
logs in at `/api/auth/login`, obtains its CSRF token from `/api/auth/session`,
and sends that token with chat and other state-changing requests.

Response shape:
```json
{
  "answer": "Employees are entitled to 12 casual-leave days per calendar year.",
  "agent": "hr",
  "sources": [
    {"document": "Leave_Policy.docx", "page": null, "section": "3.1", "score": 0.55, "snippet": "..."}
  ],
  "latency_ms": 1340,
  "llm_provider": "gemini",
  "conversation_id": "abc-123",
  "timestamp": "2026-..."
}
```

### 5. Run tests

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

## API Reference

### `POST /api/chat`
Run the RAG pipeline for an authenticated employee or administrator. Requests
require the session cookie and `X-CSRF-Token` header. Body:
```json
{
  "question": "...",
  "agent": "it",
  "conversation_id": "optional",
  "conversation_history": [
    {"role": "user", "content": "How do I set up VPN?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Follow these setup steps..."}
  ]
}
```
`agent` is optional. When supplied (as the chat UI does), the selected agent is
honored. If omitted, the backend classifies the question and routes it to an
agent automatically. `conversation_history` is optional and should contain only
the preceding turns from the same conversation (up to six messages, 2,000
characters each); it is used to resolve follow-ups and is not persisted by the
backend.

### `GET /api/health`
Lightweight liveness endpoint for Render. It returns application status without
calling Gemini, initializing embeddings, or retrieving documents.

### `GET /api/documents`
List all indexed documents across all agents (administrator only).

### `POST /api/documents/upload`
Upload and ingest a document (administrator only; requires CSRF token). Multipart form:
- `file`: the file
- `agent`: `hr|it|policy`

### `DELETE /api/documents/{agent}/{doc_name}`
Delete all chunks of a document (administrator only; requires CSRF token).

### `GET /api/analytics`
Return analytics (administrator only).

### `GET /api/health`
Return backend status, version, LLM provider, collections.

### Authentication endpoints

- `POST /api/auth/login` validates credentials and sets an expiring `HttpOnly`,
  `SameSite=Lax` cookie; production/staging cookies are `Secure`.
- `GET /api/auth/session` validates the cookie and returns the role and CSRF token.
- `POST /api/auth/logout` invalidates that server-side session and clears the cookie.
- Employees can use chat but receive `403` for document, analytics, evaluation,
  metrics, and seeding operations. The backend enforces these checks independently
  of frontend navigation.

### `POST /api/seed?force=true`
Re-seed the vector DB with sample documents.

## RAG Pipeline

```
1. Receive question and optional selected agent; classify only when no agent was supplied
2. Embed question (Chroma ONNX all-MiniLM-L6-v2 → 384-dim vector)
3. Vector search in the resolved agent's Chroma collection (top-K=5), filtering scores below 0.35
4. Rerank and deduplicate confident passages (top-3)
5. Build prompt: system prompt + context chunks + question
6. LLM generate (configured Gemini free-tier model or optional OpenAI model; provider errors are explicit)
7. Return answer + sources + latency
```

## Sample Documents (11 total)

- **HR (4):** HR_Policy_Manual_2024, Leave_Policy, Payroll_Procedure, Onboarding_Checklist
- **IT (3):** IT_SOP_PasswordReset, IT_Network_Guide_v2, Asset_Policy
- **Policy (4):** InfoSec_Policy_v4, Code_of_Conduct_2024, Hybrid_Work_Policy_2024, Security_Incident_Response

Each document is chunked (chunk_size=512, overlap=64) and stored in its agent's Chroma collection (`eka_hr`, `eka_it`, `eka_policy`).

## Frontend Integration

The frontend uses `/api/health` to discover the backend, then authenticates
through the cookie-backed session endpoints. Chat and admin operations never
fall back to mock responses. For split local development, run the restricted
frontend server on port 5500 and keep that origin in `CORS_ORIGINS`.
GitHub Pages is a static preview and cannot use this server-side authentication.

For local-only UI testing, `DEMO_AUTH_ENABLED=true` allows non-empty dummy
credentials to sign in under the role selected on the login page. This is
accepted only for loopback clients when `ENVIRONMENT=dev`; keep it disabled
outside local development.

## Optional: Use OpenAI instead

OpenAI is a paid alternative, not required for local development. To use it,
get a key from <https://platform.openai.com/api-keys> and edit `backend/.env`:
   ```
   LLM_PROVIDER=openai
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-real-key-here
   OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
   ```

Restart the server after changing the provider.

## Docker (optional)

```bash
# Build a simple image
FROM python:3.11-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
EXPOSE 8000
CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```
